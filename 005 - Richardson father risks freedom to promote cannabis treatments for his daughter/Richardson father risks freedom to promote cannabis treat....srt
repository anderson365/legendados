00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,520
O que você está assistindo agora é Mark Zartler cometendo um crime

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,280
Para ajudar sua filha, que não pode ajudar a si mesma

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,540
Dezessete anos atrás, Christy Zartler deu a luz a gêmeas

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,380
Keeley, sua irmã, veio pra casa primeiro

5
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:26,105
E três dias depois a Kara veio

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,660
E eles começaram a difícil jornada de anos

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,340
Para aprender a tratar a paralisia cerebral e o autismo severo da Kara

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,380
Isto é um anti-psicótico

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,500

There are antipsychotics
and enzymes and sleep AIDS.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,300
But few things helped find off the worst

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,180
of her symptoms
that could sometimes go on for hours.

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,660
Pretty much on a daily basis.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,380
We have some sort of episode
when it's heating up.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,940
I turn off the fan,
have a level eight of a teaspoon.

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,980
When Mark found the one thing that could

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,320
stop his daughter, he made
this video to show the world.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,960
It takes six deep breaths

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,960
and a father's dedication.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,900
The video is the truth, right?

20
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,760
That's typical of what we see.

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,540
A neighbor first suggested years ago
that cannabis could ease Keras symptoms.

22
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,820
Mark then found that by grinding marijuana

23
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,260
buds and heating them to 410 degrees
Fahrenheit, it created an immediate rescue

24
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,100
response to his daughter's
most violent behavior.

25
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,220
And by ten, she's usually back out here,
enjoying life again.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,780
For several years,
we were in fear of using it.

27
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,380
Trying it, giving it to her, having it.

28
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,760
But now there is no fear for the dark

29
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,820
Lords, who risked everything by posting
the video of Mark illegally treating Kara.

30
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,730
That more than 120 people have seen.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,060
And by talking to us.

32
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,890
I got to the point where we looked

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,020
at the law and said the law is not going
to change unless somebody gambles.

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,400
In his post, Mark asks the Texans call

35
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,220
their state senators demanding
a public hearing on Senate Bill 269.

36
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,260
It would expand the access of patients

37
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,980
with debilitating illnesses
to use medical marijuana.

38
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,920
For Kara, that law could make
moments of calm come legally.

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,860
And if showing what works for her
puts Mark in jail, so be it.

40
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,600
Okay.

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,820
Just saying,

42
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,460
if we want to make a difference
for ourselves and forgive other kids like

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,940
Kara, we just said somebody
has to take a risk.

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,280
He's another father who will
do anything for his daughter.
