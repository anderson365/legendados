00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,340
One day, I'm sitting in the house
and my son come up crying.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,680
So, you know, when your son come up

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,980
crying, you try to think about
before, like, as a grandma.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,500
Is it my Mama,
Kobe, just died in a helicopter crash.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,780
And I was just watching the night before

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,580
when LeBron passed him up,
I was like, Yellow Bush.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,180
It's a hoax.
Stop it.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,420
And Shawnee called me crying.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,420
And I said, Hold on, let me verify.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,240
And I called my guy
from the Sheriff office.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,300
He said, that's true.
I stopped crying.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,180
And I'm like, Damn it,
I didn't even haul at him.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,440
Last time we did the sit down,
everybody was waiting for that's.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,580
The last time I didn't get the number,
I didn't text him and Holland.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,220
And that still haunts me.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,800
All the shit we went through,
we could have shook hands and put

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,100
that aside because people think
it was worse than it was.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,420
It's just two brothers going at it.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,100
Two guys with difference of opinion always

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,860
tell people after my first Championship,
when I go like this,

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,620
it's a million mothers in the arena
who jumps in my arms first.

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,290
So we hate each other.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,770
How do you have that moment?

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,050
But I got a little brother.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,180
We argue all the time.
My cousin live with me.

26
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,700
We argue for a long time.

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,290
But the thing that kept
us going was the respect.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,930
When I get double team,
you know, I'm looking for him.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,490
When he gets double team by the room,
he's looking for me.

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,620
So you look at our relationship,
it was perfect, but it was non perfect.

31
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,620
Perfect that he made me
play at a certain level.

32
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,740
I made him play at a certain level.

33
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,570
Able to win three.

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,620
Did we get along all
the time on the court?

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,660
No.

36
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,980
But we know in sports that's
how it is in the locker room.

37
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,290
The only thing I regret
is I got a holiday.

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,490
Don't take time to be like,
hey, man, what's happening?

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,700
Like a text or something?
I never did it.

40
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,740
He never did it.

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,040
And that's what hurt me the most.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,570
I think about it all the time,
and I have pictures of him in my house.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,480
And when I see him take a summit.
