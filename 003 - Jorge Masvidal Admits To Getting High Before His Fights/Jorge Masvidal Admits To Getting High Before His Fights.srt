1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,420
Do you drink alcohol?
Yeah.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,530
Hearing the smoke?
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,610
They told us when you were coming.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,620
They were like, we just
want to let you know.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,140
He'S going to be baked.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,920
That's what he's going
to be fucking baked.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,100
The funny thing is, is that marijuana
gives me energy, brother.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,300
What the same.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,660
You know what he's basically saying?

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,980
Marijuana is a hammer.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,300
Some people use it to fall asleep.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,620
Other people use it
to build a beautiful house.

13
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,120
Exactly.
I could smoke on a marathon.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,140
I could smoke on a two
hour and a half practice.

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,760
Wow.
You train while.

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,940
You'Re high?

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,140
Yeah.
I'm going to say yes.

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,920
Not all of my practices,
but a lot of practice.

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm not against smoking a fat one or
maybe like four and then fucking.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,820
Okay.
I don't know if you're allowed to talk

21
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,020
about this, but what is your
favorite off market fight?

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,540
I'm talking like, you're at a tackle Bell

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,560
and this guy's, like,
chirping at you and you're like.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,020
That'S a good one.

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,100
Stating the slap is a good one.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,440
Have you ever caught in the air wall?

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,340
Hit the vehicle in time?
It right?

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,020
No, but I'm going to have to see that one.

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,080
It's a pretty good one, bro.
