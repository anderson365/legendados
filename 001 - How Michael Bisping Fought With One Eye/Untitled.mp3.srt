1
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,810
Still fight, you know, now life's great.

2
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,110
But back then I'm still very
much financially struggling.

3
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,830
And yeah, all I had,

4
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,670
I fight this court case, this legal, this
lawsuit, and that was costing a fortune.

5
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,380
And it's all I knew at that time.

6
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,550
That's one of the craziest stories ever.

7
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,230
That you won the middleweight
title with one eye.

8
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,070
Yes.
And you won it by lying to the doctors.

9
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,390
Yeah.
I was terrified.

10
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,870
I was terrified every time I felt I mean,
I don't want to say too much.

11
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,610
Didn't you fuck with your debt perception,

12
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,830
though, because that's one of the things
that they say all the time.

13
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,150
Like, I'll go and grab
that bottle, for example.

14
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,830
Now I'm fine because my brain touched it,
so I know where it's at.

15
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,950
I can judge it.

16
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,430
But the first time I miss all the time,

17
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,790
I'm always misreading how
far something is away.

18
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,390
Do you know what I mean?
Right.

19
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,750
Because you have the depth perception

20
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,790
and everything's in 2D, and then sometimes
it can fuck with me a little bit.

21
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,990
Sometimes I start getting

22
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,670
a little blurry and like,
I get a little dizzy because sometimes

23
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,220
it's only sometimes all of a sudden
I can't fucking figure.

24
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,830
What about driving?

25
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,270
Driving is fine.

26
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Everything's on the right side
to turn next to you all the time.

27
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,750
Yeah.
If I'm changing Lane,

28
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,070
I always have to give it one
of those until I'm really far.

29
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,770
And I'm always hitting people in the face.

30
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,550
And it's always an old lady the amount
of times because I'm very animated.

31
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,030
Right.
I talk with my hands.

32
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,940
Like, for example,

33
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,490
I'm at a crosswalk in New York City
and I'm in the middle of telling a story.

34
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,790
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

35
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,660
I've gone like that into someone's face.

36
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,940
And it's always a little
old lady for some reason.

37
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,990
Always they look at me like I'm
the biggest dickhead on the planet.

38
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,110
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.

39
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,220
Oh, that's horrible.
Yeah.

40
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,030
But is there any hope for your eye?

41
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,470
No, nothing they can
do in terms of repair.

42
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,390
Well, if you look at that now.
It has gotten worse.

43
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,350
Yeah.
There's just nothing there.

44
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,470
Wow.

45
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,350
When I got this done,
which changed my life in many ways,

46
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,590
to be honest,
I was just sick of looking like that.

47
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,630
You don't see anything out of it?
No light.

48
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,710
Nothing.

49
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,770
If I cover up my good eye and the lights

50
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,870
go on and off, the shade of blackness
changes just ever so slightly.

51
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,950
I can tell when the lights
gone on and off.

52
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,470
That's it.

53
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,390
And there's no replacement lenses
or anything that they can do.

54
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:51,510
I heard recently that they're putting
in robotic eyes or something like that.

55
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:51,790
Yes.

56
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,630
But I haven't looked into it yet because
two fake knees and a fake eye.

57
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,930
Imagine if it's better.
Oh, no, I know.

58
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,110
Could you imagine?
I'm fucking back.

59
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,090
Let's go.

60
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,230
I'm back.

61
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,910
One more for the road.

62
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,710
Two fake knees stepping into the Octagon

63
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,270
that would be wild fake
knees and a fake eye.

64
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,470
I think they have
an electronic eye that they've created

65
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:26,390
that offers superior vision and I think
it's just in the testing phases now.

66
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,550
But see if you can find that,
Jamie I'm pretty sure that it is superior

67
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,230
to normal eyesight and the way
that it interacts with the brain.

68
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,730
I don't understand.
I don't know how it interacts

69
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,150
with the optic nerves
and the signals that it sends.

70
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,590
Yeah, I'm sure it is better with the
technology that they have one day.

71
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,950
Yeah, absolutely.

72
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,470
That's why I retired, though,
because the doctor said and they always

73
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,410
said if something goes wrong
with your good eye, you'll go blind.

74
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:00,850
You.
