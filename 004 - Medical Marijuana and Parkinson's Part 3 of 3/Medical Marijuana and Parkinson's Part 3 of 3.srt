00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,610
Hi, Larry.
How are you?

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,240
Good.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,180
How are you feeling?

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,920
It's been a rough week, really.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,140
And the best way to take it is to put it

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,160
under your tongue and rub
it in your cheek.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,980
Don't do too much.
You're going to be asleep all afternoon.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,780
No, you should do.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,740
Don't try to communicate.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,380
Just relax.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,180
See what happens.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,960
We know from animal experiments
that the inductions cannot be in.

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,940
The system is very important
in regulating motor activity.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,100
That very type of activity that is
impaired in Parkinson's disease.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,340
From animal experiments,

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,300
we also know that boosting certain
branches of the endocannabinoid system is

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,340
helpful in relieving
symptoms of Parkinson's.

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,210
Finally, from anecdotal information,
we know that certain patients who smoke

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,130
marijuana experience
relief of their symptoms.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,020
I think you're calmed down so quickly.

21
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,740
Isn't it amazing?

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,820
He used just a single drop and his hands

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,960
afterwards were rock steady
and the Dyskinesia left.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
It works most of the time.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:53,820
Did you guys get lunch really easy?

26
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:01,460
Marijuana makes me pretty angry
that I can't get it by Allstate.

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,100
The number one frustration that I have is

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,680
knowing that there is this untapped
potential comes from what marijuana is

29
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:19,340
teaching us to generate new medicines
and being stuck because of financial

30
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,580
issues or political issues,
that is extremely frustrating.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,060
We now know that medical marijuana
controls Dyskinesia and yet it's not.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,120
It's not available to us.
